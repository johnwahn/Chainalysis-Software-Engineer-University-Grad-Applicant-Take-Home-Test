1. For this project, I wanted to use a simple API that had simple syntax and straightforward documentation. This led me to use an API source from CoinGecko,
 which is not an official exchange where you can buy and sell crypto, but has simple, accessible API documentation that allowed me to easily get the prices for
 BTC and ETH. However, this API updates the prices a bit slower than my other API source, Binanace which is an official exchange. So if I had more time, I would
 have chosen an API source that would update the prices at the same rate as Binanace in order to update the prices simultaneously.
 
2. Overall, I kept the design of the website pretty straightforward, so that I can prioritize on executing the functionalities. Although I would have loved to make
my website a bit more flashy, it would have taken to much time for me to plan out since I am personally used to the design team giving me a design. 

3. In order to handle 100 users/second traffic, I would try to transfer my web application to a serverless application in order to handle my servers. This will allow
my app to become more scalable and flexible to more incoming users. 

4. If I had more time for this project, I would have handle all my API requests through AWS API Gateway in order to make my application serverless, so that it would be
5. more scalable. I would have also focused more on the designed of the website and find better API sources that would update the prices in a more frequent manner.
